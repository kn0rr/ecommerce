# About this Repository

This repository contains basic functionality to create an ecommerce app based on JavaScript.

It is only a "non-production ready" code because it uses JSON-files for data handling.

Nevertheless it contains production ready functionalities like authentication and the handling of typical ecommerce functions.

The whole repository is based on the Udemy course [The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/).
